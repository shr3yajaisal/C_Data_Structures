# INTRODUCTION
  Welcome to my GitHub repository containing various data structure programs. This repository is a compilation of programs implementing a variety of data structures. Each data structure is implemented in C programming languages to provide a broad understanding and to cater to the preferences of different developers.

  1. Arrays
  2. Linked lists-
     - Singly linked list
     - Doubly linked list
     - Circular linked list
  3. Application of Linked list-
     - Polynomial arithmetic
     - Addition of two numbers
  4. Stacks-
     - Array implementation of stack
     - Linked list implementation of stack
  5. Application of stack-
     - Nested brackets
     - Infix to Postfix
  6. Queues-
     - single sided queue
     - doubly sided queue
     - circular queue
  7. Trees-
     - Binary Tree
     - Binary Search Tree
     - AVL Tree
     - Red-Black Tree
  8. Graphs-
     - Graph representations (Adjacent Matrix, Adjacent List)
     - Graph Traversals (Breadth First Search, Depth First Search)
  9. Heaps-
     - Minimum heap
